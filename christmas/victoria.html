                <p>Love Island originated as a British dating game show. Since its creation, there's been over 20 spinoff shows ranging from countries like Spain to Austrailia. While the show does feature a plethora of hot bods and gravure figures, the central theme of the show is to look past the outer appearance and find the deeper meaning behind personality, soul, and values to attempt a relationship that is more than skin-deep to win the show's large prize-pool!</p>

                <p>The premise behind Too Hot to Handle is very similar to Love Island: </p>
                <p>Contestants value physical relationships above all else, so the motivation to help them create deeper connections come in the form of (1) rules barring any/all physical contact and (2) a prize pool that dips anytime violations of the rules occurs. </p>

                <p>Netflix's Golden Child: Stranger Things</p>
                <p>Even though you already know what it's about, I'm going to give you a little snippet of the show's description...</p>
                <p>Set in the 1980s, Stranger Things centers around the residents of the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana, as they are plagued by a hostile alternate dimension known as the Upside Down, after a nearby human experimentation facility opens a gateway between it and the normal world.</p>
                <p>With stars, rising and old, Stranger Things changed what it meant to be a streaming-service-original. Netflix definitely rose to the top with this show alone.</p>
                <p>Based on you being my big sister, and having somewhat of a good idea of what you find appealing, I am going to present you with my list of Stranger Things hotties from your POV...BUT...it gets increasingly disturbing as you scroll >:)</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <h3>Eddie Munson</h3>
                    <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/iO4ptP2iuV29yui3mx/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47682btl2gvwu6kt6qk0m223jv8t5tuhqn7zs5qsax&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                    <p>I think Eddie's metal/rock aesthetic appeals to your emo/scene days when you were full of angst and wouldn't let me sleep in your room even though I was goign to have nightmares...but I'm over it!</p>

                    <h3>Steve Harrington</h3>
                    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o7aCVqXn0idWFuDnO/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ufwhcwtsqzf4wtl7431ccyla1zmwu1fvxzybuqyr&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                    <p>Steve Harrington is a bit of goofball. With character redemption like his, from a high school jerk to a caring mother of 6, who wouldn't have a little crush on this guy? Plus that HAIR.</p>

                    <h3>Jim Hopper</h3>
                    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/ZXqOCQLK8BKquLx56V/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e472q2uemgo56kq6ufj33vwenca06qohjjdx2sqyqgt&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                    <p>I know he's technically a cop, but I think you'd have a soft side for Jim because of his tragic backstory and the heroic vibe he gives when it comes to those he cares about. He started the show a little grizzled, but the dad bod went away and his survival in fucking SIBERIA gave him that little push he needed to slim down. All in all, he's a good family man!</p>
                    <h3>Robin Buckley</h3>
                    <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/eLqF80YGEMdBhumR7O/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47lc9z0ueqn3j2rp5js1w2r8te49czimcnd6q7tv61&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                    <p>If you were into girls, I think Robin might be a good fit for you. She's fun, sarcastic, pretty, and is also a hero of the town! Not much to say besides she's the literal daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke...Nepotism much? </p>
                    <h3>Vecna</h3>
                    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/axdUGyhEPyZ2hwMtaa/giphy.gif">
                    <p>I know what you're thinking, but hear me out...</p>
                    <p>I know he's all about world domination and stuff, but I think Vecna could have a little softy side to him if you were able to get past that hard but also squishy, tentacley exterior of his. I don't remember in the show if he had genitals, so you might be out of luck on children, but his TK powers could make chores easy and he IS already a homeowner technically!</p>

                </div>
                <p>The story follows Elle Woods (Witherspoon), a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Davis) by getting a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard Law School, and in the process, overcomes stereotypes against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer.</p>
                <p>- Stolen shamelessy from the Wikipedia description</p>
                <p>I've never watched Legally Blonde, but I know it's all about proving stereotypes wrong and that Reese becomes a lawyer or goes to law school or something even though everyone thinks she's just a dumb blonde. </p>

                <h1>The Twilight Series</h1>

                </div>
                <p>The Twilight series is about a girl named Bella Swan who falls in love with a moody, teenage but also actually old, predatory vampire named Edward Coolen (because he's so cool) and their attempt to break the barriers of human-vampire relationships. Also there's like a vampire government that opposes the relationship and werewolves are a thing too except they're actually Native Americans but never seem to wear shirts.</p>
                <p>I will attempt in my best Benjamin words to summarize the entirety of the Twilight series in the following sections.</p>
                <h2>Twilight</h2>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/l41Yy7peNVGqSa5O0/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47f9wsgf1l9yorqb1wrir25cpv4odfmo9c85kgrgym&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                </div>
                <p>So basically, there's this girl named Bella Swan. She's part bird and from Arizona. Her Mom is choosing to follow her boyfriend or whatever on his pro-baseball journey, and so she kicks Bella to the curb like any mother would and has her stay with her father, Charlie Swan, in Sporks Washington. </p>
                <p>Now, Bella grew up in Sporks before where she had a little Native American friend named Jacob. You get to see him for like 2 minutes, but don't worry...He'll be back...but his shirt WON'T.</p>
                <p>Anyways, Bella tries to continue life in Washington by going to high school. Bella is big news when it comes to this high school because apparently no one ever decides to visit Sporks, so she's the cool new student. She gets the attention of a little group of friends who were too unimportant to actually be popular in a small-town high school, so it fits the narrative of the story perfectly.</p>
                <p>At lunch with her new friend group, Bella sees the cafeteria door open with dramatic gusting-winds, shining lights, and a kickass mysterious song and in comes the Coolens. They're literally the coolest figures in the town. LITERALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE VAMPIRES AND THEY HAVE NO BODY HEAT. Bella catches the eye of the Coolen with the biggest hair, Edward.</p>
                <div class="img-container">

                </div>
                <p>Not a lot of interesting stuff happens from the point where she catches his attention and on...I'll just list the main things</p>
                <li>Bella and Edward are lab partners and win the GOLDEN ONION.</li>
                <li>Edward thinks Bella smells, like serious B.O.</li>
                <li>There's a group of other vampies who are wreaking havoc because they're cool and no one is gonna stop them, more on that later.</li>
                <li>Bella and Edward's family play baseball, OH and Bella already knew Edward is a vampire because she's not an idiot.</li>
                <li>That other group of vampires has a shirtless guy who wants to kill Bella because he's like a furry or something and thinks he's hunting like an animal would.</li>
                <li>Bella gets tricked to go to a ballet studio by the furry-vampire and Edward comes to her rescue.</li>
                <li>Bella almost gets turned into a vampire but Edward sucks the venom out like he's taking a jello syringe shot.</li>
                <li>Bella and Edward live happily ever after and nothing else bad happens because I am too lazy to summarize the rest of the movies</li>
                <p>Instead of summarizing the rest of the movies, I'm going to include some cool gifs that show the movies best!</p>
