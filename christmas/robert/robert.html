                    <p>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the only fullmetal show I recognize. Anything else is incorrect and doesn't belong on the internet!</p> 
                    <div class="show-desc">
                        <p>Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, raised in Resembool by their alchemist mother Trisha, lose her to illness. Abandoned by their father, they attempt forbidden human transmutation to bring her back. The failed ritual costs Ed his left leg and Al his entire body. To save Al, Ed sacrifices his right arm to bind his soul to armor. After receiving automail prosthetics, they become State Alchemists, embarking on a quest for the Philosopher's Stone to restore their bodies. The journey uncovers a government conspiracy involving homunculi, Xing alchemists, Ishval's scarred man, and their mysterious father. </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>To make a long description short, and paraphrased by yours truly...Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the best animes/manga to ever exist. Edward and Alphonse Elric are two brothers who, in an attempt to bring back their dead mother, sacrifice more than just body parts during a human transmutation ritual. With missing body parts, affinities for alchemy, and an entire world to explore, FMA: Brotherhood follows the Elric brothers and their friends on a journey that explores concepts of humanity, immortality, what one would give to achieve power, and the true concept of sacrifice.</p>

                    <h2>If I were to choose a FMA:B character that represented you best...</h2>
                    <h3>Edward Elric?</h3>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/45335f2a8f00c0d16b6bcabf7620de2b/tumblr_mr6dj6PQFP1rwn6joo1_500.gif">
                    </div>
                    <p>Of course there's always Ed. The MC. Edward is a handsome young man with a strong sense of responsibility and care for those he considers close. Much like you, Ed is resourceful and often has a lot more going on in his brain than he initially shows on the outside. An outstanding martial artist and master of alchemy at a young age, I would consider if we were in the FMA:B universe, you could probably give him a run for his money...if he was blind, deaf, and had his arms tied behind his back! </p>

                    <p>Now, if not Ed...</p>
                    <h3>Scar?</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>You do happen to have the same skin color as Scar! Scar has tattoos on his arms...you have tattoos on your arms. Scar has shorter hair...you have shorter hair. While you don't have red eyes, white hair, or a war-refugee backstory, I can physically see some similarities between you and Scar, but that's about where it ends. Scar is broody, has a grudge against State Alchemists for war crimes committed during the Ishvalan Civil War, and eventually redeems himself by allying with those he once considered his enemy. Not really applicable to where you're at in life, I would say...</p>

                    <p>I would say Sloth is a good fit for representing you. I mean...look at those MUSCLES. Sloth wants nothing more than to relax, do nothing, and especially not work...sound familiar? You and Sloth could be chilling and possibly lifting weights if he weren't a deadly homunculus ordered to assist the Father in becoming God. I'd be like General Armstrong or Sig Curtis because of my incredible stature and physique!</p>

                    <p>House Ferros was mentioned by the Piltovan Council and it plays a very significant role in the progression of Runeterra as a whole. As a handful of people might know, House Ferros is headed by the family of Camille and is the primary distributor for hex-crystals in Piltover. However, the house has its dark side as the hex-crystals is an extremely limited resource so they have to resort to extreme methods to make sure that they monopolize the market.</p>

                    <p>"Spirited Away" is an animated fantasy film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It follows Chihiro, a young girl trapped in a magical world where her parents are transformed into pigs. To rescue them and escape, Chihiro navigates a surreal bathhouse owned by the powerful witch Yubaba. The film is renowned for its breathtaking animation, imaginative storytelling, and exploration of courage and compassion in the face of adversity.</p>
                    <p>One thing I love about Spirited Away, and pretty much all Studio Ghibli movies, is the atmosphere and vibes they have. I know you love Spirited Away and know the story, so I'm just going to throw in some of my favorite gifs that showcase the calmness that is Spirited Away...</p>

                    <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
                    <p>Here's a fun little activity. I'm going to try and summarize each movie in a single sentence. As Victoria can probably tell you once she's done checking out her page... I attempted this for Twilight but with much less success and much more inital writing. This is why I limited my summary for these movies to a single sentence LOL</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    <p>Wee little Harry Potter discovers he's a wizard and is taken to a famous magic academy where a new professor who you kind of think is muslim at first but really has a face on the back of his head has a grudge against a 12 year old...and also there's a troll in the bathroom or something like that.</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h3>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    </div>
                    <p>Slightly older Harry Potter is back for another year at Hogwarts where that once defeated face on the back of some turban dude's head is back for revenge but it's actually a version of him from the past and he's a teenager and he lives inside a diary and also Harry can talk to snakes.</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>

                    <p>Harry Potter has grown older, as one usually does, and reunites with a dangerous escapee from the wizard prison Azkaban who he comes to find out is actually his Godfather and not a crazy person because he was completely a victim of human/wizard rights' violations by soul-eating demetors which Harry also gets the succ from... and also there's a werewolf and stuff.</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>I'm gonna be honest I don't remember much about this one except I know for a FACT that Harry Potter is older and there's this secret team of wizard spies like MI6 or Mission Impossible or something like that but they're good guys and also I think this is the movie Sirius dies :(.</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h3>
                    <div class="img-container">

                    </div>
                    <p>Say it with me..."Harry Potter is now older" and he falls in love with a potions brewing book because he's a little wizard nerd who uses cheat codes for class and also Snape is the Half-Blood Prince and also Dumbledore has to die and everyone raises their wands to the sky.</p>
                    <h3>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>I'm combining the last two  because I am running out of effort for these movies.</p>
                    <p>Here we get to see Harry Potter at his OLDEST (at the very end of the movie) but these movies mark an end to the fued that is Harry Potter, good wizards, and Hogwarts versus Voldemort, bad wizards, and whether bad wizards learn magic from... and also there's a children's story about 3 powerful magic artifacts that actually exist and is probably one of the coolest animations ever.</p>
