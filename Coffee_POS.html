        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Benjamin's Coffee POS is a POS system designed to simulate the order creation/taking experience a barista might encounter during business at a coffee shop. My goal with this program is to demonstrate my ability to create a working program that has value to an end user and combines my two passions, coffee and programming. The POS application is built using Java, JavaFX, and Gluon's Scenebuilder along with design choices from my experience as a barista.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Feature 1: Creating a drink ticket - This feature allows the user to create a drink ticket that includes the type of drink and any alterations to the drink so the baristas may craft a perfect beverage to satisfy the customer. This is important because it is tool that allows barista's to read the blueprint to the drinks they must craft. 
            </li>
            <li>Feature 2: Describe what this feature does and why it's important.
                Feature 2: Total price - This feature allows the user to view the total price of a customer's order, which includes the drinks they order as well as any upcharges added for altering the drinks. This is important for record-keeping purposes as well as customer satisfaction to ensure customers are able to view and confirm they are receiving the quality food and service that they are being charged for.
            </li>
            <!-- Add more features as needed -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p> 
            I plan to polish out the orientation/organization of elements within the GUI using a CSS stylesheet in the future. I also would like to incorporate some sort of time-tracking feature that keeps record of when an order is created and when the order is processed. In the future, I would like to incorporate a database that would allow the application to log/organize orders for a business day for record-keeping/customer service purposes possibly using SQL or MongoDB.
