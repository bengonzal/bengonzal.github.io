                        Hi there! If you're reading this, it means you managed to somehow stumble onto my personal blog. Welcome! My name is Ben and I'm a born and raised Arizonian (Arizonan?) just trying to survive in this desert heat. I'm new to web design and blogging in general, but after observing many personal and professional blogs (glancing at a few after quick Google searches), I have determined that all blogs need a focus, topic, or central theme. This blog's theme will be ... ME! A little about me: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am 24 years old at the time of creating this blog, so while I do have some experiences in life, I am still but a young babe.</li>
                        <li>I graduated from Arizona State University in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a concentration in Software Engineering.</li>
                        <li>I have a wonderful and loving girlfriend who has been my biggest supporter and I am happy to pen some of our adventures on here!</li>
                        <li>I am all about family. My family means the most to me and I would say that is what I am most passionate about!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="purpose">
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>There are a couple of purposes I had/have in mind creating this blog.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning web development - I want to use this to teach myself some fundamentals when it comes to web design and development</li>
                        <li>Therapeutic purposes? - I have always found some sort of journaling to be therapeutic and this will be like an online journal that allows me to vent, rant, celebrate, and put my life out there!</li> 
                        <li>Last but not least... Connecting with others!</li>
                    </ul> 
                </div>
                <h2>I want to use this to connect with others. </h2>
                <h2>I want to be able to put my life out there for the world to see what it's like! If anything in this blog interests you, then follow along and join me on the many adventures I plan to have living an ordinary life!</h2>
