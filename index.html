    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello there! My name is Benjamin, but everyone calls me Ben. I am currently working as a barista, crafting tasty drinks and being a caffeine courier. My passions include coffee, clean energy, technology, the outdoors, and my family. In my free time I like to play video games, learn random things through YouTube videos, and exercise.

    <h2>ASU SCAI Graduate</h2>
    <p>
        I graduated from the Arizona State University School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) in May 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. 

        During my time at ASU, I learned a multitude of new skills and worked to strengthen existing ones. 

    </p>
    <p>
        In my general studies, I worked towards strengthening:    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Management</strong> - Learning to balance my academic studies with my work life, social life, and relationship was a big learning experience that taught me the value of time management in a professional and personal manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Learning new concepts in general and concentrated studies taught me to critically think about and analyze information that had been presented to me before through a new lens and further established my ability to form a well-reasoned argument.</li>
            <li><strong>Oral Communication </strong>- Speaking and listening to classmates, professors, and professionals allowed me to work on my comprehension and my ability to communicate effectively through spoken word to present an idea, take in a concept, or establish a connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Communication </strong>- Through essays, reports, and reaching out to my peers and professors, I strengthened my ability to communicate effectively through written word.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In my Software Engineering concentrated studies, I worked towards strengthening:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming Languages</strong> - In nearly all my CS classes, I learned about the fundamental paradigms of different programming languages and worked towards developing familiarity and experience with languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, and Java.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong> - With my degree's concentration in Software Engineering, I learned about the different phases of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms </strong>- I learned to develop a solid understanding of the fundamental data structures used in programming/software and the algorithms used upon those data structures to perform specific actions efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Testing and Debugging </strong>- A very particular quality assurance course I took taught me the importance of regularly testing at every phase of the SDLC and how it could (1) improve the development of said software, (2) save the company a large amount of costs and headaches from fixing errors later in the cycle, and (3) generating test cases that benefit not only the end user, but the development team as well.</li> 

        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>General Dynamics Mission Systems: OKL4 GUI - C++, Qt</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my senior capstone project, I was assigned to collaborate with others on my team towards the development of a graphical user interface for General Dynamics Mission Systems's OKL4 Type I Hypervisor. Previous capstone groups had already worked on the development of the GUI, so our group was to continue working on fixing bugs, implementing design changes, and following the Agile method to gain real-world experience of working on an important project.

    <h3>My Webpage - HTML</h3>
    <p>In an effort to learn more about HTML, I made it a personal project to put together my own resume/portfolio using the Github Pages hosting service. Everything you see has been hand-typed by yours truly while I learned about HTML.
