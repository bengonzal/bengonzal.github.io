        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        Hello! My name is Benjamin and I am an aspiring software engineer hoping to create software that will be used by many to make their lives easier and more productive. Some of the skills that I bring to the table (and hopefully your team in the near future) are problem-solving, agile learning, strong soft skills, and the strength and determination to learning anything I can to get the job done correctly and efficiently.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Management</strong> - Learning to balance my academic studies with my work life, social life, and relationship was a big learning experience that taught me the value of time management in a professional and personal manner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Learning new concepts in general and concentrated studies taught me to critically think about and analyze information that had been presented to me before through a new lens and further established my ability to form a well-reasoned argument.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Communication</strong>- Speaking and listening to classmates, professors, and professionals allowed me to work on my comprehension and my ability to communicate effectively through spoken word to present an idea, take in a     concept, or establish a connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Written Communication</strong>- Through essays, reports, and reaching out to my peers and professors, I strengthened my ability to communicate effectively through written word.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages</strong> - In nearly all my CS classes, I learned about the fundamental paradigms of different programming languages and worked towards developing familiarity and experience with languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, and Java.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong> - With my degree's concentration in Software Engineering, I learned about the different phases of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms </strong>- I learned to develop a solid understanding of the fundamental data structures used in programming/software and the algorithms used upon those data structures to perform specific actions efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Testing and Debugging </strong>- A very particular quality assurance course I took taught me the importance of regularly testing at every phase of the SDLC and how it could (1) improve the development of said software, (2) save the company a large amount of costs and headaches from fixing errors later in the cycle, and (3) generating test cases that benefit not only the end user, but the development team as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Version Control, Git</strong> - After working on projects for courses as well as my main capstone project, I became familiar with the Git version control software. Although I would still like the ability to practice more, and would by no means consider myself an expert, I would say that I am overall familiar with how to use version control software. If I'm not familiar with a different version control software, I can say it would not take me too long to learn how to use it efficiently.</li>
