        <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3 style="color:maroon; background-color: gold;">Arizona State University, AUG 2021 - MAY 2023</h3>
                <p>I graduated from the Arizona State University School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) in May 2023 with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. It was at ASU I concentrated on pursuing knowledge in the field of computer science and software development. My academic course load consisted of general computer science classes as well as software engineering specific classes including Software Integration and Engineering, Distributed Software Development, Software Analysis and Design, and Software QA and Testing.

            <h3 style="color:silver; background-color: teal;">Chandler Gilbert Community College, AUG 2017 - MAY 2020</h3>
                <p>I recieved my Associate's of General Science degree at CGCC in order to get my general prerequisite courses completed at a discounted rate compared to university tuition. At CGCC, I discovered my passion for coding after taking an introductory Java programming course. I loved the feeling of working on a program and "solving a puzzle" so-to-speak after I was able to make a function complete a task. That feeling of accomplishment still remains in me today when I compile a program without errors and it functions correctly!</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Management</strong> - Learning to balance my academic studies with my work life, social life, and relationship was a big learning experience that taught me the value of time management in a professional and personal manner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Learning new concepts in general and concentrated studies taught me to critically think about and analyze information that had been presented to me before through a new lens and further established my ability to form a well-reasoned argument.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Communication</strong>- Speaking and listening to classmates, professors, and professionals allowed me to work on my comprehension and my ability to communicate effectively through spoken word to present an idea, take in a     concept, or establish a connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Written Communication</strong>- Through essays, reports, and reaching out to my peers and professors, I strengthened my ability to communicate effectively through written word.</li>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages</strong> - In nearly all my CS classes, I learned about the fundamental paradigms of different programming languages and worked towards developing familiarity and experience with languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, and Java.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong> - With my degree's concentration in Software Engineering, I learned about the different phases of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms </strong>- I learned to develop a solid understanding of the fundamental data structures used in programming/software and the algorithms used upon those data structures to perform specific actions efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Testing and Debugging </strong>- A very particular quality assurance course I took taught me the importance of regularly testing at every phase of the SDLC and how it could (1) improve the development of said software, (2) save the company a large amount of costs and headaches from fixing errors later in the cycle, and (3) generating test cases that benefit not only the end user, but the development team as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Version Control, Git</strong> - After working on projects for courses as well as my main capstone project, I became familiar with the Git version control software. Although I would still like the ability to practice more, and would by no means consider myself an expert, I would say that I am overall familiar with how to use version control software. If I'm not familiar with a different version control software, I can say it would not take me too long to learn how to use it efficiently.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>General Dynamics Mission Systems: OKL4 GUI - C++, Qt</h3>
                <p>As part of my senior capstone project, I was assigned to collaborate with others on my team towards the development of a graphical user interface for General Dynamics Mission Systems's OKL4 Type I Hypervisor. Previous capstone groups had already worked on the development of the GUI, so our group was to continue working on fixing bugs, implementing design changes, and following the Agile method to gain real-world experience of working on an important project.

            <h3>My Webpage - HTML</h3>
                <p>In an effort to learn more about HTML, I made it a personal project to put together my own resume/portfolio using the Github Pages hosting service. Everything you see has been hand-typed by yours truly while I learned about HTML.

            <h3><a href="https://bengonzal.github.io/Coffee_POS">Coffee_POS</a> - Java, JavaFX, GUI</h3>
                <p>Connecting two of my passions, programming and coffee, I am attempting to create a basic coffee point-of-sale system to simulate the software a barista might encounter during their work.</p>
