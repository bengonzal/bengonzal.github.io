                <h1>Favorite Show(s)</h1>  
                <h2>Video Game High School</h2>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/4-14-2016/t4qxMX.gif">
                </div>
                <p>Now here's something I don't know too much about! When I was making all the other siblings pages, I was able to write about their favorite shows with little to look up but I haven't ever seen this so I'm going to make this fun.</p>
                <p>Given the following show description: </p>
                <div class="show-desc">
                    <p>The series is set in the near future where video games elevate their best players to stardom by their position as the world's most popular competitive sport.[3] Video Game High School (VGHS) is an elite and prestigious facility that teaches a curriculum of video games of all genres. The show's protagonist, BrianD, gains entry to the school after unwittingly defeating "The Law", an international first-person shooter star, on live television. The show follows BrianD and the friends and enemies he makes at the school, playing on standard tropes of school dramas with a video game background. </p>
                </div>
                <p>I am going to put a couple gifs from the show in here and give my best guess as to what I think is going on!</p>
                <h3>Let's Begin</h3>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/7-31-2016/mrWXW-.gif">
                    <p>Here we have this guy, I'm gonna guess his name is Parker or something plain like that, and a girl, Kimberly, in a good ol' Mexican standoff. I can say it's a Mexican standoff because I'm Mexican. Parker has Kimberly's entire family held hostage and is making his ransom demands in exchange for their safety, but this is all happening in the virtual world...or is it. Kimberly is actually acting scared but she knows that Parker poses no threat because she secretly freed her family from the warehouse Parker was hiding them in 3 hours prior. Yeah. That's totally what this one is about.</p>
                    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/QZrLm6qcnpcAAAAM/vghs-tamewater.gif">
                    <p>This one is easy. Obviously we have 2 gentlemen exchanging words in a friendly conversation and one gentleman is wondering where his good pal got his manners from. He's guessing the rude store but I would guess that the fine gentleman was raised by 2 new york mobsters, so while his manners may appear rude, he is actually just a New Yorker.</p>
                    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/il5PNXaElaUAAAAM/peace-out-leaving.gif">
                    <p>I know this one. That man most definitely shit his pants. That's the "I shit my pants and have to crab walk to the nearest toilet so my shit doesnt roll down my legs and cake my thighs with even more caca.</p>
                    <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/xT9DPxf2vjL1BTglj2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47pm4880ipl80gyt5egv22wjv6ukou2pu4pwfuc7d2&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
                    <p>This is obviously American stunt performer and entertainer Evel Knievel's cousin Kevin Seblevin attempting to break his family's record of "How many feet can I vertically bicycle up the wall."</p>
                    <h2>Okay, you got me. I don't know anything about what's going on in Video Game High School, but I can guess it's a good show because it's your favorite show!</h2>

                <p>I've never actually seen this one either! I remember Tio putting it on once, but I don't remember what the movie was actually about. I know it has something to do with Halloween and that's enough to be cool to me.</p>

                <p>He's so innocent and sweet! Nothing bad happens in this movie...right?</p>
                <div class="show-desc">
                    <p>In the opening scene, Emma and her Halloween-loving husband Henry return home after a celebratory night. Emma (who hates Halloween) blows out their jack-o'-lantern before midnight against Henry's superstitious advice. As Henry relaxes and falls asleep in the house, Emma begins tearing down the decorations; but is then ambushed and murdered by an unseen assailant. Hours later, Henry discovers her mutilated corpse on display with the decorations.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Oh boy..that's only the opening? Sounds like a good Halloween movie!</p>
