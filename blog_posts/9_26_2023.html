            <h2>A trip to the cabin</h2>
            <p>This past weekend my best friend Rob invited Rose and I to spend some time at his grandparents' cabin and wow was it nice. I am such a big fan of the foresty, woodsey (?), atmosphere, and even though it is cooling down in central Arizona, it was nice to head to somewhere cooler! We hungout with him and his girlfriend, spent some time in the town, had a great dinner, and ended the night with a nice time around the fire! It is one of my favorite things when you can sit around a campfire and for the next couple of weeks your clothes smell like campfire smell. Mmmmmm.</p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.mortimerfarmsaz.com/">Mortimer Farms</a></h2>
            <p>On our way back, Rob and Hannah invited us to check out this cute little place called Mortimer farms, and I had a blast (almost literally). After a little drive from his grandparents' cabin, we made it to Mortimer farms where we were greeted by the Mortimeter farms Market and Deli! They had all sorts of nice farm things inside like jellies and jams, fresh fruits and vegatables, fresh dairy products and meats, and plenty of baked goods! We planned on grabbing some stuff on the way out, so we headed to grab some wristbands and went out to the actual farm area which was pretty big. Rose and I were pretty hungry so we went to grab some food at the opened windmill kitchen and got some yummy mac and cheese, fries and onion rings, and finished with pumpkin cheesecake and apple crumble. Because it was outside, there were plenty of bees (to Hannah's dismay) and I let a couple drink from my soda so they wouldn't bother us when we were trying to eat our food!</p>

            <p>Because it was a farm, we were able to see some of the animals they had there and there were plenty!</p>

            <p>The goats were my favorite because I love their derpiness and horizontal pupils!</p>

            </div>
            <p>We also saw some chickens and some not-chickens!</p>
            <h2>Plenty of Plants</h2>

            <p>Here is a lovely picture of Rose when we were standing near the flower fields. She wanted to go and pick a giant sunflower stalk, but it was way to far in a thick brush of thorns, bugs, and FROGS. She almost stepped on a frog, and that would have been the end of her if she felt the squish!</p>

            <h1>She thought the flowers were pretty but I had the most beautiful view.</h1>
            
            <p>Nearing the end of the trip, the mac and cheese had caught up with me and I desperately needed to use a bathroom, but the universe had it out for me. The only thing that was available were port-a-potties and boy did they seem like outhouses. I spent probably around 6 minutes standing in RDL position with a grand canyon hanging over that hole and had a terrible time. After it was done, my lovely girlfriend got me some gatorate and water to replenish my lost fluids and we made our way back home to get some rest after a nice weekend retreat.</p>
            <h1>If you're reading this, thank you Rob and Hannah for being such wonderful people and inviting us over for a wonderful weekend. We love you guys!</h1>
