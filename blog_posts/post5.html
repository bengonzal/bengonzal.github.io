            <h1>My Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence</h1>

            <h3>Disclaimer!</h3>
            <p>I want to first point out that I am no expert when it comes to the concept or field of AI. I have no background in studying AI or machine learning. I am simply a user of AI tools, as are many of you (unintentionally or intentionally), but I have some thoughts on the matter because I've been seeing articles pop up on Reddit lately about the "next big AI that will eliminate the need for x, y and z".</p>

            <h1>What is artifical intelligence, or AI?</h1>
            <p>Here's the answer OpenAI's ChatGPT gives when I ask, "What is artifical intelligence, or AI?": </p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It is a broad and multidisciplinary field of computer science that aims to create intelligent agents or systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.</p>
            <p>From my limited knowledge on the topic, AI can be categorized into 2 types: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Narrow/Weak AI - like Siri, Alexa, recommendation systems, or image recognition software</li> 
                <li>General/Strong AI - human-like intelligence that can perform tasks as well, or better, than a human can</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>AI is all around us now, whether we like it or not.</h1>
            <p>AI has been integrated into much of your lives, whether you realize it or not. If you're reading this blog, you've indirectly interacted with AI, or AI generated content. During the creation of this blog, I used AI to help generate webpage templates and teach me the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and designing my own webpage. Unless there is some sort of EMP device that renders all computers on the Earth disabled, AI is here to stay, and I have some thoughts on the matter!</p>
            
            <h1>I do not believe AI is the "Holy Grail" most corporations pan it off to be.</h1>

                <figcaption>POV: A corp just added a useless AI chatbot to its barely useable website and explains to its shareholders the expected result.</figcaption>
            </section>
            <p>I understand the main goal of any business is to generate profit. Whether it's by selling a product or selling a service, corps nowadays have LEAPED at the opportunity to incorporate an AI feature into their business models. Microsoft is a massive tech company and is responsible for BingAI becoming a neat AI chatbot that can generate artificially created images when given a prompt. Apple and Amazon have used Siri and Alex respectively as their AI device assistants for quite some time now. Go on any career website nowadays and you'll find an AI chatbot at the bottom, or side, of your screen asking if you need assistance today. I can tell you one thing ... that's not a real person you're talking to! More than likely, you already know that! The answers it gives to your questions seem weak and repetitive, almost as if its capabilities aren't complex enough to answer your specific questions. Companies invest a LOT of money to bring features like that into their business in the hope that it will cause customers like you and me to throw more money at their products, but we know better!</p>
            
            <h1>AI shouldn't be something that eliminates tasks entirely from our lives.</h1>
            <p>Humans have done many things in the name of convenience. </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> Don't have time to preheat the oven? Throw your food in the microwave!</li>
                <li>Taking the stairs is too much of a hassle, you don't want to get sweaty and out of breath! Take an elevator or escalator instead!</li>
                <li>
                    Don't feel like taking time out of your day to go to the grocery store and gather all your groceries? Order for pickup instead!
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Of course each of these things has helped those who are unable to do them without assistance, I must admit. BUT! I think if you are able to, carrying out the tasks without as much assistance can be more beneficial than the time/hassle you save by using the shortcut!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the oven can thoroughly cook your food and leave a nice crisp finish that you can't quite get from a microwave!</li>
                <li>Using the stairs gets your heart pumping and keeps you healthy and fit!</li>
                <li>Online grocery orders aren't 100% reliable. Things can be substituted or not to your standards, but you wouldn't know unless you witnessed the item in person! </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>I think AI should be a tool to use as an aid, not a solution to everyday tasks.</h1>
            <p>I would have been able to create this website without the use of ChatGPT, but admittedly it would've taken much longer than it has. The nice thing about using ChatGPT to LEARN instead of using ChatGPT to SOLVE my website problem is that I am able to insert my own creativity with less effort and focus more on understanding how to develop. I don't need to worry about going onto StackOverflow and being ridiculed for asking a beginner question which would deter me from learning any more in the first place. Maybe this is an extreme that my mind likes to rush towards, but if we were able to use AI as a tool to aid in our everyday lives, and NOT try and create sentient/conscious robots, maybe we wouldn't put ourselves at risk of creating a Terminator type situation where humanity ends.</p>

            </section>
            <p>AI needs to be trained properly, and as easily as it is able to scan through data and draw conclusions, it is up to humans to sort through disinformation and establish credibility from sources.</p>
            <h1>That's my rant. Thanks for reading if you did! </h1>
            <h1> I don't think AI is some magic bullet that will create a utopia on Earth as we know it, but it could be a valuable tool we might be able to use to advance our society for the better!</h1>
