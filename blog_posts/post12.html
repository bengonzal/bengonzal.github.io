            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>It's been about 8 months since I graduated from ASU with a B.S. in Computer Science. My concentration was in software engineering. I remember watching the "day in the life of a software engineer" videos and dreaming about my future. Sadly, that's not how things are looking at the moment! Currently, I've lost count of how many positions I've applied to. Whether the title is "software engineer", "entry level software associate", "software engineer intern", etc. I have been struggling to keep track of the companies that either: (a) send a rejection email days after I apply OR (b) ghost me entirely. It's a tough market out there right now! </p>
            <h2>What have you done to combat this problem?</h2>
            <p>I've done a couple of things that definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow in order to increase my odds of landing a position.</p>
            <p>I have: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Networked on LinkedIn and with any connections I might have</li>
                <li>Rewrote my resume multiple times and had it professionally reviewed by someone in the industry (Thank you Matt!)</li>
                <li>Worked on expanding my skills through online learning, personal projects, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sadly, I believe the software engineering industry is a bit saturated with people like me... people who were told, "Just get a degree with and you'll have a job in no time. It's a position in high demand!"</p>
            <p>Now I guess the entire saying was, "Get a degree. On top of working to afford the tuition for that degree, join clubs/extracurriculars/volunteer. On top of those, get an internship. On top of that work on side projects. It's a position in high demand" ...of experienced individuals who've already been in the industry for the past X years.</p>
            <h2>So, what now?</h2>
            <p>What a great question!</p>
            <p>I am currently looking for other career opportunities that can help me get started. I have plans that I want to achieve, and unfortunately I need a livable wage to make that happen. As much as I'd like to continue working in the coffee industry, I don't see myself earning enough to support future plans. I will continue working at my part-time job as a barista, but I am on the lookout for other opportunities.</p>
            <p>I'm not entirely sure what else I can get started with where a B.S. in CS would help with, but I'm willing to try quite a bit. I have family members who work as maintenance technicians in the semiconductor industry, so I'm trying to explore those areas if available. I also recently went through the steps and am awaiting a fingerprint clearance card to open the possibility of some sort of substitute teaching gig that can buy me some time.</p>
            <p>I just don't want to have to go back to school for an entended amount of time in order to open something else up. As much as I'd love to play "student" again, I have bills that need to be paid. I thought that the degree I studied for would give me the opportunity to pay back the loans I took out for it, but that's not the case at the moment. I know that I am a smart individual who can learn what needs to be learned, so if the right opportunity presents itself, I'll jump at the chance! No more waiting for companies to never get back to me!</p>
            <h2>That's the end of my rant!</h2>
            <p>If you've actually read this, then I thank you for being patient and letting my vent my frustrations to you.</p> 
            <p>I'm going to be exploring all sorts of options in the coming months. I want this year to be a good year where I can get my career and life plans started. I won't let a closed door keep me from living the life that I want to live, so maybe you'll hear more about my career opportunities in the near future!</p>
