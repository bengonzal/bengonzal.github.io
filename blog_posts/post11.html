            <h1>This is more directed to those who have been in, or graduated from, college... do you know what industry you would like to work in?</h1>
            <p>I have a degree in Computer Science. A lot of times I think I'm too hard on myself because I don't have a wildly successful job at the moment, but I forget to realize that getting a Bachelor's degree from an accredited University is a massive achievement! The only issue that I have is that a CS degree is a pretty general degree when it comes to the tech industry. To my credit, I did study with a concetration in software engineering, but that's still not as specific when it comes to what employers might be looking for. I could have chosen to study for a degree in Artificial Intelligence - so hot right now - or something along the lines of data science, but alas, I am still satisfied with what I obtained from ASU.</p>
            <h2>If I could go back and choose a specific degree, would I change anything?</h2>
            <p>I can't say that I know for sure I would change my major if I were able to go back in time. I know that I might choose to go a little more specific, but I would say even now, I am still unsure of exactly what kind of industry I want to work in. Deciding between what I find interesting, what I'm passionate about, and what I can picture as being secure can let my mind run rampant if I don't take a step back lol. It was this back and forth between topics that got me inspired to make this post and point out what I find interesting, so let me show you!</p>
            
            <h2>What am I interested in?</h2>
            <h3>Automotive Industry</h3>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/6ZWcJSzOdNlPTviK5I/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47qhb5c4g98pv6xuctru3x13tsimflf9t1nz0n4yfo&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
            </div>
            <p>I didn't get into liking cars well until I was able to drive one. Growing up, my friends were always talking about going to car shows, what they were working on in their garage, and what their dream cars were. I was more concerned about having a car that had a working AC and fuel gauge HA! It wasn't until I had been driving for a while and had the perspective to see what I would want out of a driving experience that I began to be interested in wanting to work for an automotive company as a software engineer (SE for short!).</p>
            <h4>Ever heard of Apple Carplay or Android Auto?</h4>
            <p>That's all possible thanks to software engineers/developers!</p>
            <p>If you have ever used either of the mobile connections to a car with a screen, you know it's near impossible to revert back to driving without it. The convenience of having music, map directions, and message notifications seamlessly integrated with your driving experience is something that can't be taken for granted. While I think it'd be interesting to work on those types of softwares for car companies, I would also be interested in working on the behind-the-scenes tools that make cars run! Mechanics/mechanical engineers/fabricators are responsible for building the cars together piece-by-piece, but I would like to think software engineers have a small hand in making sure the computers within cars help complete the puzzle that allow for our cars to be as technologically advanced as they are. </p>
            <p>I think it'd be interesting to be a part of the team that makes cars do smart things, don't you?</p>

            <h3>Clean Energy</h3>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/OnavQV9tvZVks/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e471fyvn3lkx106zdu64sy4jil579mk23a8hztamp0b&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
            </div>
            <p>Okay, I have a couple of reasons as to why I'd like to work in any sort of renewable resource/clean energy position as a software engineer!</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>I am passionate about nature!</h4></li>
                    <p>I love nature. I love the environment. I would like if people were more conscious about how their choice and actions affect the environment! I'd like to be able to contribute to clean energy solutions that could have humans leaving as minimal a carbon footprint as possible. Whether it's contributing to software that manages the efficiency of solar panels or creating systems that are responsible for the management of energy production by green sources, I'd like to do my part for nature!</p>
                <li><h4>I think clean energy is secure!</h4></li>
                    <p>The world is already working towards carbon-neutral, and even carbon-negative, energy solutions. The world is plenty aware of climate change, CO2 pollutions, and ways to work towards limiting the CO2 output we produce for energy, and society is only moving faster in that direction when it comes to climate policies. As society chooses to adopt cleaner and more renewable climate policies, the security of those contributing to the software and computing resources that enact said policies increases. I'd like to have job security, and if it means being a software engineer for corporations or organizations that produce clean energy, then sign me up!</p>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Healthcare/Biomedical Science</h3>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/XBG7cm3CaVPKTmFS7w/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47xysf0yixda4iiaghpb4y3nlcoz3gya45kst6lgki&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g">
            </div>
            <p>You probably didn't know this but...I wanted to be a doctor before I decided to go towards the software engineering field. I thought being an anesthesiologist would be interesting, but then I realized just how much time I'd have to spend in school to achieve that goal HA!</p>
            <p>It is of my personal opinion that working in tech in the healthcare/biomedical industry would sound cool as heck. Imagine working on software that could help diagnose cancer earlier and increase someone's chance of survival! Imagine working on software that could control a device that regulates the beating of someone's heart or determines when/how much insulin someone with diabetes might need!</p>
            <p>Unless someone finds the solution to immortality, I don't think tech-oriented positions in the healthcare/biomedical industry are going away anytime soon, so I would say that could be a pretty secure job! It's also something I find particularly interesting, and I would like to think I'm passionate about helping others so it's a triple threat!</p>
