            <p>I had a sudden burst of inspiration and found ways to spice up the blog! I'm going be adding some new sections to the blog. Things like my interests, my zombie boy, video games? Interested?</p>
            <h1>BRAINSTORM TIME</h1>
            <p>Wow this is such an exciting time in the life of this blog. Adding new sections? It's like the Renaissance but not at all because it's just new ideas for my silly little blog. Anyways, here are some sections I'm thinking of adding to the blog to really flesh it out and give this place some personality. </p>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I like to play videos games in my free time when I can! I'm not currently enjoying a story driven game right now so any time I play a game it's either a fast paced game like Apex Legends or a slower, more relaxing game like Minecraft. This section would be about gaming topics like what I'm playing at the moment, things I might like to see out of upcoming games, and my adventures playing Soulsborne games with my paleblood Rob.</p>

            <h2>Movies</h2>
            <p>I think I get my love for movies from both my parents. My dad is the biggest Disney fan I know (Sorry Gina), so I know practically all the animated movies that have come out from that sector. My mom on the other hand likes to watch a variety of movies, so both parents know what's up. I like to watch any kind of movie really, as long as I have some time to get into it! I know for some movies I have to be in a certain mood to feel like I can really enjoy it. THAT is why it took me about 3 years to actually watch The Greatest Showman even though my sister and cousin kept asking me to watch it! This section would be about movies I'm watching, movies I'm excited for, movies I'm NOT excited for, and anything inbetween!</p>

            <h2>Zombie</h2>
            <p>This section has already been implemented thank you very much. I'm not sure how Github's hosting works or the amount of storage I'm able to take up in a repo, so this could be a Zombie dog gallery that is a massive wall of all things Zombie OR it could just be a rotating slideshow that has the latest pictures of my sweet little boy. Either way, the people will get what they want and Zombie's own section will remain updated!</p>

            <p>That's all I really have right now! My inspiration has left the body, coincidentally as soon and I got up to go do a load of laundry. Will I implement stuff that I mentioned in this post? The world may never know... just kidding. </p>
