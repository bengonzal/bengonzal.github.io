            <h1>I love the forest, woods, cluster of trees...</h1>
            <p>If you know me, you know that I love the outdoors! More specifically, you would know that I akways talk about wanting to move to somewhere in the Pacific Northwest whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Something about the forest just speaks to me. I love the big pine/evergreen/redwood type trees that seem to blanket miles of land. I love how dark and gloomy it seems all the time, especially when it's rainy year-round. I don't have any issues driving in the rain, like most Arizonians seem to HA! I love when you can just smell the freshness of the air in forest towns and places like Payson and Flagstaff. As much as I love the forest, I don't really have much experience visiting those kinds of places. Payson and Flagstaff are the most relevant places I can say I've visited that have that fairy-forest type atmosphere, and I'm sure if you've lived in a place where there's sunshine and warm weather 3 out 365 days, you'd disagree that it's the happiest place to be. But I love it! It's is why I was so excited to be able to visit Washington with my lovely girlfriend Rose for a couple of days.</p>
            <h1>Washington with Rose</h1>
            <p>This past week or so Rose and I went on a trip to visit her aunt and cousin, and we both had a great time! It rained, we saw plenty of trees, and we were able to celebrate his birthday with him. When we had a little free time, Rose and I went on our own little solo adventures where we walked around the neighborhood, drove in downtown Seattle, and saw the Fremont Troll! I really enjoyed my time up there, and I think Rose did too!</p>
            <h1>My favorite memories made on the trip:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Rose squashing a giant mushroom as I was trying to record it </li> 
                <li>Walking in the cold, freezing, wet, and drippy droppy rain wif Wose - contributed by Rose</li>
                <li>Eating Ben&Jerry's marshmallow sky ice cream cake</li>
                <li>Eating Beecher's world famous mac and cheese</li>
                <li>Waiting line for gas at Costco while we were in a rush to pick someone from the airport</li>
                <li>Watching them throw the fish at Pike's Place</li>
