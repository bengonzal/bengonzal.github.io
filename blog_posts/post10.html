                <h1>Why work on a website redesign?</h1>
                <p>I've been getting more familiar with CSS, HTML, and what I would want to see as a website viewer, so I figured I'd design my website with a couple of ideas in mind!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You, the visitor, would find it easier to navigate/read my posts if the website flowed more consistently and was appealing to the eyes.</li>
                    <li>I am able to show the progress I've made in my webdev journey if I update the website to look better than before.</li>
                    <li>I am going to keep the previous posts implemented/designed how they were before, so my progress is that much more obvious. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="how">
                <h1>What have I done to improve my design?</h1>
                <p>I'm working towards making my website easier to follow, navigate, and appear on your screen, regardless of what type of device you have. Just like no one is born drawing photo-realistic faces, It's going to take me a bit of time to get everything figured out. I know viewing from different phones can sometimes cause images to overlap text, text be cut off from the screen entirely, or the format of the page to look weird, so I'm working on making the website responsive to fit generic device properties instead of hardcoding properties to be a one-size-fits-all type thing!</p> 
                <h2>Home</h2>
                <p>I've made it so the home page is more organized and simplified. Each post has its description/post-contents, a button to go to the post, and a thumbnail that might help you, the viewer, visualize what the post is going to be about! From now on, I removed the footer at the bottom of the home page, as well as the bottom of the posts, because I think I might include it in the about page. If you REALLY want to find my Linkedin, YouTube, or Instagram, you'll probably put a little extra effort in searching for it anyways.</p>
                <h2>Blog posts</h2>
                <p>If you want to see how it used to be, just take a look at any previous post and notice how different it looked! I've changed up the color scheme, and I'm going to try and have things a bit more uniform and organized from now on sort of like a standard of quality for each element/the website.</p>
                <h2>About page</h2>
                <p>The changes for this page are pretty simple. I changed the color scheme and the picture. I didn't do much to the layout because it was pretty simple and the majority of the post consisted of text.</p>
