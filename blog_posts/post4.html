            <h2>It's been a bit, hasn't it?</h2>
            <p>The last blog post I made was on Sept 26, which was over 2 and a half weeks ago! Time sure does fly when you're busy! I've been held up by some things, so let me catch you up on how I've been.</p>
            <h2>Since I last posted, I have: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>had to deal with getting new tires on my car, because it was time for a change</li>
                <li>went to the Scoring the End of the World Tour with Rob and Hannah (feat Motionless in White, Knocked Loose, After the Burial, and Alphawolf)</li>
                <li>interviewed for 2 jobs, one I managed to get and is partially the reason of this post!</li>
                <li>Visited Mom and went to her Dia de Los Muertos party to kick off spooky season!</li>
                <li>watched two friends get married at a beautiful wedding!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Let's go down one by one, shall we?</h2>
            <h3>New tires</h3>
            <p>Fairly recently, I went on a trip with my lovely Rose for our 2.5 years of being together and realized part of the way through the drive that the tread on my tires were VERY LOW. I didn't bother to check the tread a good time before the trip to actually change them before we hit the road, so part of the way through the trip I had to stop in a side town and pay almost $200 for a SINGLE tire change and installation! It was on the worst tire, where the tread was easily flush with the wear bars, so I had to get it changed ASAP. We were able to make the rest of the journey and back safely without anything happening to the other tire, so that's that! I got back and my dad graciously ordered and set up an appointment for me to get my tires swapped, so I'm now road ready! (hopefully)</p>
            <h3>Scoring the End of the World Tour</h3>
            <p>A band that I used to listen to a long time ago was the headlining a tour that also included 2 newer bands I enjoy, so a while back I bought tickets for Rose and I, and asked Rob if he and Hannah would like to go! The tour consisted of:

            </section>
            <p>I included these embedded spotify links so you can listen to a preview of what the tour was like!</p>
            <p>In short, I liked the concert, minus After the Burial because we were in line for merch when they were playing! Motionless in White did a great job performing and had lots of effects and cool visuals, but they could've definitely eased up on playing so many songs! Knocked Loose killed it as always. Alphawolf did great as the opener, but they could've chosen a couple of stronger songs to get the crowd going!</p>
            <h3>Mom! and her fun Day of the Dead party!</h3>
            <p>I was able to visit my mom for a couple of hours one day, and I had a ton of fun! I was able to see my uncle, who is doing much better after some tough times, beat my mom in Scrabble (which is a big accomplishment), eat some of her amazing cheddar-chicken-broccoli casserole, and enjoy some quality mother-son time! I miss my mom, so it was nice to be able to spend time just hanging out!</p>
            <p>A couple of days after my mom and I had our hangout day, it was time for her Day of the Dead party! My mom has been wanting to have a little celebration to kick of the start of the spooky season, so she put a lot of effort into planning and cooking a day of the day party! The food was incredible, the games were fun (even though I didn't win at Loteria), and the decorations and atmosphere were amazing! You did a great job mom, I know it started the Halloween season off perfectly for me!</p>
            <h3>Wedding!</h3>
            <p>I had the lovely opportunity to watch some friends I've known since high school get married, and it was beautiful! The ceremony, decorations, and reception were all incredible, and it seemed like everybody had a fantastic night! I know I had a little too much to drink, but what else can you do when there's an open bar and you're a lightweight? I was thankful my beautiful and amazing Rose was able to go as my date to the wedding becuase we got a glimpse of ideas we might have for ours in the future! (O,  w  ,o)</p>
            <p>Joey and Gina, congratulations! I hope you guys have/had(?) a wonderful honeymoon and can enjoy your time as newly-weds!</p>
            <h3>New job?</h3>
            <p>I saved this point for discussion last because it goes a little with the reason for making this post! I had the opportunity to interview for 2 positions recently. One position was for an office coordinator at the company I work for right now, and although I thought the interview went great and I was totally qualified for the position, I didn't get a second interview :(</p>
            <p>The other position was for a seasonal hire at Costco, and I don't know how many of you are familiar with Costco, but even the seasonal hires make a good amount more hourly than I do right now. I was grateful to be able to accept that position, and even though it is only for this upcoming busy holiday season, I am hoping that I can stay on as a full-time employee at the end if they would have me! I know the work is hard, but I would eventually like to work my way up to the corporate offices in Washington as a Software Engineer and carry out what I spent so long studying for at University! Only time will tell, but as of now, I am going to enjoy learning new skills, working my ass off, and saving money with 2 part-time jobs that hopefully ease the bills.</p>
            <p>With those things being mentioned, I had an idea for a program that could showcase a little of my skills with working on automation tasks. Costco's scheduling system doesn't allow for importing/exporting into a digital calendar, HOWEVER -- it does show the calendar on a webpage that is (hopefully) neatly formatted and able to be scraped which I can then use to transfer to an ICS file (importing/exporting to/from a digital calendar like Google calendar or iCalendar). That is my program idea! I'm writing it down right now to be able to remember when/what I wanted to accomplish, so hopefully in the near future I am able to make a post showing off my work!</p>

            <h2>If you've made it this far and haven't fallen asleep, thank you for reading. I will try and keep the posts weekly and keep you updated in how my life is going!</h2>
