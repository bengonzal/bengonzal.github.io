            <h1>Had to cancel working on the Costco schedule scraper</h1>
            <p>Some unfortunate news...not really that unfortunate...more of just a change of plans?</p>
            <p>I had to cancel working on the Costco schedule scraper. I was working on the implementation and seeing if I was able to hold an html page to scrape all the data off the page the schedule was on but it turns out, the html pages that I was holding had some sort of interaction/processing that wouldn't let me download the page the schedule was on. So I dropped that project and went on with my days! 
            </p>
            <h1>How's Costco?</h1>
            <p>I've been working at Costco for about a month now, and I like it! I clock in, listen to whatever the supervisors tell me to do whether that's load up carts, backload carts, bring carts in from the corrals, or walk through the store returning go-back items. It's easy work and keeps me active so I get to reap the benefits of being paid to move around!</p>
            <p>I am currently only a seasonal employee, so I have no guarantee of being kept on at Costco past the 1st of January. If I were to be kept on I think I'd try to follow a plan along the lines of: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Work part time/full time</li>
                <li>Continue working on personal software/programming projects and applying to SE jobs</li>
                <li>Network and try to connect with persons in Costco corporate to transition to Software Engineering for Costco.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I know that's a longshot of a plan, but that's one of the routes I'm exploring while the market for all sorts of software engineering jobs are tough to land even an interview for new grads.</p>
            <h1>Trying to get back out there in the SE field</h1>
            <p>It's been 6 months since I graduated from ASU with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. Since then, I've applied to countless entry level/new grad/junior software positions and internships and more received rejection emails than I can count. It's tough out here, but nevertheless I've had a second wind of applying to companies, exploring options, and reaching out to connections to try and get my foot into the door, and I'll get as many winds as I can until I'm satisfied with a beginning to my career.</p>
            <h1>That's about all for now </h1>
            <p>That's pretty much what's been going on in my life as of now. I had the amazing opportunity to go on a trip to Washington with my lovely Rose and visit her aunt and cousin. It's been a blast and I've been taking plenty of pictures and videos that I can make a post with soon! I also have a programming project that my best friend Rob has had the opportunity to play around with and I'm excited to make a post about that too. </p>
            <h1>Thanks for reading! </h1>
