            <p>This is my first official blog post! This is mostly a test more than anything to be honest. I am going to try and learn some CSS and HTML while also creating a little web journal of things I find interesting, things I relate to, thoughts I might be having, and pictures I take! Interested?</p>    
            <!-- Add more content here --> 
            <p>So far I feel like I've already learned a lot but I know that I'm barely scraping the tip of the iceberg that is HTML and CSS! I don't have any current plans to delve too deep into javascript at the moment because I want to keep this blog fairly simple!</p>
            <p> With that in mind, I am going to try and embed something cool into this...</p>
            <div class="youtube-video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TO4cQ-FrVxA?si=-CoLzrn-wcvcnLzg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>This is a cool YouTube channel I follow that is pretty much all about camping. The creator's name is Go4x4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@go4x4media">(Check them out here!)</a> and they post a bunch of relaxing, calm camping videos which I have been interested in lately! I think they're based out of Austrailia because a lot of the locations they mention in their videos are all in Austrailia so if the shoe fits...</p>
            <h3>And that ends this post! I'm just getting started with this and will be updating my blog regularly with whatever I want! Check back for my latest music interests, conspiracies I have about where I live, thoughts on movies I've seen lately or anything else!</h3>
