                <p>I definitely think this could be entertaining for a while, only if I were able to somehow cosmically see the peoples' reactions when they open my fortune cookies. I'd like to think I could scare some of them with eerie fortunes like...</p>

                <p>Okay so apparently this might actually be a real occupation. I guess mattress companies have quality control people they hire to sleep on and test their mattresses for comfort. I bet you I could do this for at least a couple of weeks without any issues.</p>
                <p>I'd test out a couple of things with each mattress like...</p>

                <p>This would be a fun one I think. I don't know if I believe in ghosts entirely, but I would like to hope that they're real. If ghosts are simply the spirits of humans who haven't moved on to the other side...wouldn't they be somewhat harmless? </p>
                <p>I'd like the thrill of being in the dark and calling out to see if something responds. It would get the heart racing! Also, if you've ever seen Ghost Adventures then you'd know it gets pretty silly, so that makes me think it'd be fun if I could do it with friends.</p>
                <p>Another important question: If I soaked some gloves in holy water, do you think I could punch a ghost in its dumb little ghost face? </p>
                <p>Sorry, that was a strange thing to ask.</p>
