                <h3>It's been a while since I've made a post!</h3>
                <p>It's been about 2 months since my last post. Technically 2 months and 5 days! I've been up to a couple of things and lost track of time, interest, and motivation to keep up with blogging/vlogging. I had some nitro cold brew this morning so I'm caffeinated and motivated to make at least one post. Let me tell you what I've been up to since January.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>January</h3>
                <p>The most important thing that happened in January was my lovely Rose's birthday. We had a nice little party to celebrate her turning 22 this year! We ate nice food, had some good drinks, and sang some karaoke. I recorded a weekly vlog leading up to her birthday that you can find on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcn8Ksq2N0c">HERE.</a></p>

                <p> That's something new I've been doing too. I've been trying to record videos, mostly vlogs. I was consistent for about 2 weeks and then I lost interest? Working the same shifts every week at Dutch and not doing anything particularly interesting sort of caused me to lose motivation to record stuff that was happening in my life. I've come to realize that I need to create interesting things to record, and not just record interesting things that are already planned! So, maybe you can look forward to some of that stuff coming up?</p>

                <p>Rose and I also had a trip up North in January. We went to visit the snow and managed to get a little bit at the Snowbowl in Flagstaff. Besides the lack of snow, we had a great time up there! It's funny, almost to the day a week after we went, there was a huge snowstorm that left the road up to Flagstaff inaccessible. I think next time we'll plan around the weather and try to make some quality snow angels.</p>

                <h3>February</h3>
                <p>February is where some more exciting stuff happened for me. I started to take my health more seriously, not that I was ignoring it before, but I made an effort to visit a doctor to check up on my health and try to establish a plan to be healthy! I've been fairly consistent with working out and exercising, but it's the food that's been a troubling part of life for me. It's very easy to fall victim to your tastebuds and indulge in the things that taste so good yet are so bad for your overall health! So, I've made a difference since then, I'd like to think at least. I've tried to change my mindset when it comes to my diet. I'm exchanging regular sodas to zero calorie sodas if I'm drinking them at all. I've been trying to limit myself on things like coffees, sodas, and anything that isn't water. I've also opted to try and cook more at home, and that's been a success and interesting adventure that I've taken with Rose. We've made some pretty good things in the kitchen!</p> 

                My sister, mom, and I also had an spur of the moment camping trip this month as well. My girlfriend gave me the recommendation over the phone as my sister and I were walking past a kiosk of sleeping bags in Walmart. That little push from her was all we needed to plan a quick day up in Prescott where we spent the night at a campground covered in snow! We got to try out a bunch of new camping equipment I got for previous birthday's/graduation gifts. Our 8 person tent was more than enough room for the three of us and our dogs Zombie and Hades. One thing I will say is, camping on a whim is a good way to find out what equipment you're missing for future camp adventures. I had to use a couple of different tools to split logs because I didn't have any sort of hatchet or axe, and it took us a good amount of time to actually get a fire started! There's no motivator quite like the freezing cold when you're trying to get a fire started.</p>

                <p>Oh, besides my health, I managed to do one other small thing. I got a different job! I am going to be working as a garment technician at a company that contracts for the company a few of my family members work at.Very exciting! It's not my dream job, but it's definitely an open door that can lead me to explore more opportunities if given the chance. February is when the initial interviews and background screening for this new job began, so I still had a few days working at Dutch slinging coffees and energy drinks.</p>

                <h3>Current Day Benjamin</h3>
                <p>The beginning of this month (March), I had the pleasure of actually following through on a plan and attending the Arizona Renaissance Festival with some family. We drank plenty of hard cider, ate bread bowls filled with chili and spinach and artichoke dip, and walked around looking at all the trinkets and goods the artisans and vendors had to offer. I'm pretty sure I got a little sun burnt, so wear sunscreen if you're going to go!</p>

                <p>Last week, Rose suprised me with a tattoo of something I've been wanting to get for a while now. I was completely thrown off when we were driving because I was under the impression that we were on our way to a double date with one of her friends, but as we were making our way she got giddy and asked if I wanted to know where we were going! I've talked to her before of wanting to get an Ouroboros symbol tattooed, and little did I know, she had been planning for months to surprise me with an appointment! I got it on my left elbow, and it hurt, but I look super cool and badass now.</p>

                <p>This past weekend I had a little daytrip with some of my sibs to Payson to get away from the suburbs/city and walk in nature a little bit. It was nice! The weather was perfect. We got to visit a mushroom themed coffee shop. We went on a hike and ran out of breath a couple of times. We ate some good BBQ and once everyone got home, we crashed!</p>

                <p>Yesterday I went to watch Dune Part Two with my Dad in IMAX. That was such an experience and I don't think I can watch Part Three any other way when it comes out! I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi movies, especially the ones with massive landscapes and intergalactic politics.</p>

                <p>That brings me to today! This coming weekend marks the day Rose and I will have been dating for three years! It's crazy how time flies and how one person can help you grow so much in such a short time. She's just special like that I guess hehe. The following week I am to start my new job, so I'll write about how that goes and any exciting thoughts/feelings that might come up as a fresh employee!</p>

                <p>That about sums up how I've been, and some of the things I have to look forward to sharing with you in the near future! Thank you for reading, and be on the lookout for more stuff from me!</p>
